    "text": "2.1 Sets, unions and intersections\nThese notes largely focus on parametric inference. Parameteric inference relies on distribution theory. Distribution theory relies on probability theory. Probability theory relies on set theory.\nBut we cannot cover all of set theory, probability theory, distributional theory, and inference in a single document or course. So in these first few chapters I am presenting small corners of each field to you for reference, no more than you need to build a solid understanding of the predictive models in the later chapters.\nSets are collections of objects, and set theory helps us talk about these collections of objects: how many there are, which objects can be found in two different sets, etc. Set theory seems quite basic, but it’s very relevant to probability because one way to think about probability is to divide “the number of desired outcomes” of an experiment by “the number of total outcomes” of that experiment, which requires us to know how to arrange and count outcomes.\nLet \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) be a set, that is, a collection of objects. The objects could be numbers, or words, or cars, or anything at all. We call each object that belongs to a set an element, and if an element named \\(x\\) belongs to the set \\(\\mathcal{S}\\), we write:\n\\[x \\in \\mathcal{S}\\]\nWhile if another element called \\(y\\) does not belong to the set \\(\\mathcal{S}\\), we write:\n\\[y \\notin \\mathcal{S}\\]\nIf a set \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) contains all of the elements that belong to another set \\(\\mathcal{B}\\), we say that \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) is a subset of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\), which can be written:\n\\[\\mathcal{B} \\subseteq \\mathcal{A}\\]\nNotice that this leaves the possibility that \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) are in fact equal, the same set. If we know that \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) is actually smaller than \\(\\mathcal{A}\\), that is, \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) contains all the elements in \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) and also other elements not in \\(\\mathcal{B}\\), then we say that \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) is a proper subset of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) and we write:\n\\[\\mathcal{B} \\subset \\mathcal{A}\\]\nSometimes two sets share certain elements, and we want to identify only those elements which appear in both sets. We call this new set the intersection, and we could write:\n\\[\\mathcal{A} \\cap \\mathcal{B} = \\{x: x \\in \\mathcal{A} \\textrm{ and } x \\in \\mathcal{B}\\}\\] Other times we want to identify all of those elements which appear in either set. We call this new set the union, and we could write:\n\\[\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{B} = \\{x: x \\in \\mathcal{A} \\textrm{ or } x \\in \\mathcal{B}\\}\\]\nWe occasionally find it useful, after defining a set, to also consider every known object not in the set. If an element \\(x\\) does not belong to a set \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) then it belongs to “\\(\\mathcal{S}\\)-complement”, often written \\(\\mathcal{S}^c\\).\nJust above, I wrote “every known object”, and that is also a set worth naming. Let us say that we have some way of knowing all the elements which could or could not belong to any given set. This universe of elements is given lots of names, including the universal set and also \\(\\Omega\\), Omega, the last letter of the Greek alphabet and therefore literally the ultimate set.\nWhat about a set with no elements at all? Such a thing exists and is often quite useful, just as the number 0 is useful to us despite not doing much. We call it \\(\\emptyset\\), the empty set (sometimes just called “null”).\nConsider some basic results which flow from these definitions:\nIf, for any two sets \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{B}\\), we know that \\(\\mathcal{A} \\cap \\mathcal{B} = \\emptyset\\) then they have no elements in common and we say that the sets are disjoint.",

    "section": "2.2 Combinatorics",
    "text": "2.2 Combinatorics\nAnother part of set theory studies how to arrange and count the elements in a set. We call this topic “combinatorics”.\nYou may remember a mathematical operation called factorial, written with an exclamation mark (!). Its definition for non-negative integers is:\n\\[x! = x \\cdot (x-1) \\cdot (x-2) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1\\]\nSo, for example, \\(3! = 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 6\\), and \\(10! = 3\\,628\\,800\\).1 This operation will be very handy for counting arrangements of objects. Let’s now consider several different situations in which wish to count arrangements. In all of these examples, we will suppose that we have a set \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) containing \\(n\\) elements. Sometimes we will be studying arrangements of all \\(n\\) objects, but if we are arranging a different number of objects, I will generally call that other number \\(k\\).\n\n2.2.1 Ordered arrangements without repetition\nFirst, let us consider how many ways we can arrange the \\(n\\) elements of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) in a particular order. For example, let’s say that I am on vacation for five days starting Monday, I have brought five different t-shirts, and I intend to wear a fresh shirt every day. I can select any of the five shirts Monday night. On Tuesday, I can choose from the four remaining shirts. On Wednesday, no matter what I picked Monday and Tuesday, I will have three choices left. On Thursday, two choices. On Friday, only one shirt is left, and I must wear it. Thus I count \\(5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 5! = 120\\) shirt arrangements.\n\n\n2.2.2 Ordered arrangements with repetition\nSecond, let us consider how many ways we could arrange the elements of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) in a particular order if we now allow repetition. Reconsidering the previous example, what if I were comfortable wearing the same shirt on multiple days, perhaps even every day (yikes)? On Monday, I would have five choices of what to wear. On Tuesday I would also have five choices: I could repeat Monday’s shirt, or choose any of the others — and so on throughout the week. Thus I count \\(5 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5 = 5^5 = 3125\\) different shirt arrangements.\nFurthermore, we can generalize this method to cases where we arrange \\(k \\neq n\\) elements of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\): if I were only vacationing for three days but brought five shirts, there would be \\(5^3=125\\) arrangements, or for seven days, \\(5^7=78\\,125\\) arrangements.\n\n\n2.2.3 Ordered subsets without repetition (permutations)\nThird, let us consider how to order only a subset of elements, without repetition. Say that I brought five shirts, I wear a fresh shirt every day, but the vacation lasts only three days (perhaps I wanted backups for spills or rain). The calculations proceed as in the first case above: I have five choices on Monday, four choices on Tuesday, and three choices on Wednesday — and then I’m done, and thus I count \\(5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 = 60\\) shirt arrangements.\nNote that \\(5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 = (5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1)/(2 \\cdot 1) = 5!/2!\\) or equivalently \\(5!/(5-3)!\\). We will use this result to show a general form below.\n\n\n2.2.4 Unordered arrangements without repetition (combinations)\nFourth, suppose we no longer care about the order of elements, and only care about which elements are picked or not picked. Perhaps I am packing five shirts for my vacation, and choosing them from my closet which has a total of nine shirts. How many different bags could I create? The bag doesn’t know or care which shirts will be worn on which days… a vacation where I wear the red shirt on Monday will create the same bag as a week where I wear the red shirt on Friday. Using the third case above, we know there are \\(9!⁄4! = 15\\,120\\) ways to create an ordered subset of five shirts from a set of nine. But using the first case above, we also know that for any five shirts, there are \\(5!=120\\) ways to order them. Combining this information, we see that each of the \\(15\\,120\\) ordered shirt arrangements belongs to a group of \\(120\\) duplicate bags which only differ by their order, so we need to shrink our total by a factor of \\(120\\), leaving \\(15\\,120⁄120 = (9!/4!)/5! = 9!/((9-5)!5!) = 126\\) possible ways to pack my bag.\n\n\n2.2.5 All possible unordered subsets (the power set)\nFifth and finally, let us consider how many possible subsets we could construct, without specifiying size or order. Let us repeat the bag packing question (how many possible bags can I create?), but allowing me to pack any number of the nine shirts (not just five). To answer this question, I will show that it is equivalent to another, simpler question. Consider that each of my nine shirts can either be in or out of the bag. So each possible bag can be thought of as choosing from a set of two elements (“in” and “out”) nine times (once for each shirt), with repetition allowed. Following the logic of our second case we know there will be \\(2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 2^9 = 512\\) possible bags Notice that these bags will include one with all nine shirts, as well as a bag with no shirts at all (double yikes, but mathematically valid).\nLet’s review:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nLet \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) be a set of \\(n\\) elements. Then,\n\nThere are \\(n!\\) ways to arrange the elements of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) in order.\nThere are \\(n^k\\) ways to pick \\(k\\) elements of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\), if we allow repetition.\nThere are \\({}_{n}P_k = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!} = n \\cdot (n-1) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (n-k+1)\\) ordered subsets of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) having exactly \\(k\\) elements. These ordered subsets are called permutations.\nThere are \\({}_{n}C_k = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}\\) unordered subsets of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) having exactly \\(k\\) elements. These unordered subsets are called combinations, and in this text we will use \\(\\left(\\begin{array}{c} n \\\\ k \\end{array} \\right)\\) synomously with \\({}_{n}C_k\\). Statisticians often read this aloud as “n choose k”.\nThere are \\(2^n\\) distinct (unordered) subsets of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\), including \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) itself and the empty set \\(\\emptyset\\). This set of all possible subsets is called the power set.",

    "section": "2.3 Probability as counting cases",
    "text": "2.3 Probability as counting cases\nWe will soon explore a more formal definition of probability, but learning the combinatorics shown above leads to an immediate payoff: we can use them to calculate probabilities for a specific (yet common) scenario.\nWe often face a situation in which a finite number of outcomes are all equally likely. For example,\n\nIf we roll two six-sided dice, we have an equal chance of each of 36 ordered results (e.g. Roll #1 is 2 and Roll #2 is 5)\nIf we draw five cards from a 52-card deck, we have an equal chance of each of \\(311\\,875\\,200\\) possible ordered hands, or an equal chance of each of \\(2\\,598\\,960\\) unordered hands.\nIf we split 24 students into six groups of four, there are roughly 4.5 trillion groupings which are each equally likely, if we order neither the groups themselves nor the students within the groups.\n\nIn each of these cases, we can evaluate the probability of certain outcomes by counting the number of cases with the desired attributes and dividing by the number of total cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor any finite set \\(\\mathcal{A}\\), let \\(n(\\mathcal{A})\\) be a function which counts the number of elements in \\(\\mathcal{A}\\).\nNow consider an experiment with a set of outcomes, \\(\\Omega\\). Exactly one outcome from \\(\\Omega\\) must happen, and all outcomes are equally likely to happen. For any subset \\(\\mathcal{A} \\subseteq \\Omega\\), the probability of an outcome belonging to \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) can be calculated as: \\[P(\\mathcal{A})=\\frac{n(\\mathcal{A})}{n(\\Omega)}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe above result is only true for situations with a finite number of equally likely outomes. At the moment, we haven’t learned enough to prove which situations meet that requirement, nor to prove the result is even true: we are proceeding on assumption.\n\n\nFrom here, we can start to calculate some actual probabilities. Suppose we are dealt five cards from a standard 52-card deck: what is the probability of being dealt exactly one pair (two matched cards and three unmatched cards)?\n\nThis question is complicated, because many pairs are actually part of a more valuable hand: three-of-a-kind, four-of-a-kind, a full house, or two pairs. We don’t wish to count those hands, even though they contain pairs.\nAlthough order doesn’t matter, suppose that the first and second cards are paired, while the third, fourth, and fifth cards are unmatched. The first card can be anything (52 choices). The second card must be one of the three remaining cards of the same rank (3 choices). The third card can be anything except the rank of the pair (48 choices). The fourth card can be anything except the rank of the pair or the rank of the third card, since that would form a second pair (44 choices). And likewise for the fifth (40 choices).\n\\(52 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 48 \\cdot 44 \\cdot 40 = 13\\,178\\,880\\) would describe the number of hands where the first two cards form a pair. But there are other hands with one pair, such as when the first and third cards are paired. In fact there are \\({}_5C_2 = 5!/(2!3!) = 10\\) different ways the pair could be arranged in our hand. So there are in fact \\(n(\\mathcal{A})=131\\,788\\,800\\) ordered hands with exactly one pair.\nThat would be among \\(n(\\Omega) = 52 \\cdot 51 \\cdot 50 \\cdot 49 \\cdot 48 = 52!/(52 - 5)! = 311\\,875\\,200\\) total ordered hands.\nIn which case the probability of exactly one pair is \\(n(\\mathcal{A})/n(\\Omega) = 134\\,534\\,400/311\\,875\\,200 \\approx 42.3\\%\\)\n\nLet’s try one more example, this time somewhat more relevant to a real-world data science issue. Consider an allegation of discriminatory hiring practices. 15 pilots interviewed for five open positions at an airline. 10 of the 15 candidates were men, but only 2 of the 5 selected pilots are men. One of the rejected male pilots claims that the hiring process was unfair. What do you think?\n\nThere are \\({}_{10}C_2 = 10!/(2!8!) = 45\\) unordered ways to choose 2 men from among 10 male applicants and \\({}_3C_5 = 5!/(3!2!) = 10\\) ways to choose 3 women2 from among the remaining 5 applicants, so we have \\(n(\\mathcal{A}) = 45 \\cdot 10 = 450\\).\nThere are \\(n(\\Omega) = {}_15C_5 = 15!/(10!5!) = 3003\\) unordered ways to choose 5 pilots from the 15 total applicants.\nIn which case, if we assume that the successful pilots were selected at random (or at any rate not on the basis of their sex), the probability of selecting exactly 2 men and 3 women from 10 men and 5 women would be \\(n(\\mathcal{A})/n(\\Omega) = 450/3003 \\approx 15.0\\%\\).\nIt might be useful to also contemplate the case of picking only one male candidate, or zero male candidates. Using similar calculations, the cumulative probability of picking “so few or fewer” male candidates under an assumption of equal probability would be \\(501/3003 \\approx 16.7\\%\\)\n\nAt the end of the day we cannot tell whether the hiring process was fair or unfair. But we can say that an impartial hiring process which was blind to pilot sex would reach a similar outcome (or a more extreme outcome!) roughly \\(16.7\\%\\) of the time.\n\nNotice how in the first example, I found it easier to count ordered cases, while in the second example I found it easier to count unordered cases. As long as both my numerator and denominator are consistent, the answer will come out the same.",

I counted ordered hands to find the answer, though order doesn’t matter. Try to find an unordered solution, which should arrive at the same answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution (theoretical)\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 13 ways to choose the rank of the pair, \\({}_4{C}_2\\) ways to choose the two suits of that rank which will form the pair, \\({}_{12}{C}_3\\) ways to choose the three different ranks of the remaining cards, and four choices of suit for each of them. \\[\\frac{13 \\cdot {}_4{C}_2 \\cdot {}_{12}{C}_3 \\cdot 4^3}{{}_{52}{C}_5} \\approx 42.3\\%\\]\n\n\n\n\n13*choose(4,2)*choose(12,3)*4^3/choose(52,5)\n\n\nAssume that birthdays are evenly distributed across a 365-day (non-leap) year. In a classroom of 23 students, what is the probability that at least two of them share a birthday?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution (theoretical)\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are so many ways in which two or more students could share birthdays that it will be easier for us to consider the complement: how many ways students could not share any birthdays. Clearly, the first student can have any birthday, but the second will only have 364 qualifying options, etc. \\[P(A) = 1 - P(A^c) = 1 - \\frac{{}_{365}P_{23}}{365^{23}} = 1 - \\frac{365 \\cdot 364 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot 343}{365^{23}} \\approx 50.7\\%\\] This is sometimes known as the birthday “paradox”, as it may surprise you that such a small classroom would most likely contain a shared birthday.\n\n\n\n\n1-prod(365:343)/365^23\n\n\nIn 1919, the statistician Ronald Fisher heard his colleague, the phycologist Muriel Bristol, claim that she could tell whether milk was added to hot tea, or whether the tea was poured directly onto milk. Fisher tested her by pouring eight cups of tea, four one way and four the other, and serving them to her in a random order which she was able to identify with complete accuracy. If Bristol knew that there were four cups of each type, what would be the probability that she identified them all correctly by chance alone?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution (theoretical)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis one’s quite simple! There are \\({}_8C_4 = 70\\) ways to arrange the four milk-first cups among the eight total cups, and if Dr. Bristol had been guessing at random she would have selected each arrangement with equal probability, and so would have chosen the right arrangement with only \\(1/70 \\approx 1.4\\%\\) probability.\n\n\n\n\n1/choose(8,4)\n\n\nHow would the problem above change if Muriel Bristol had not known there were four cups of each type?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution (theoretical)\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout knowing in advance how many cups had milk poured first, Bristol would have been guessing blindly on each new cup, with her guesses for the first few cups providing no information on the latter cups. The experiment now allows \\(2^8=256\\) possible cup sequences, with only one being correct, so if she were guessing at random then a perfect score would only occur with probability \\(1/256 \\approx 0.4\\%\\).\n\n\n\n\n1/2^8",

    "text": "3.1 Experiments\nIt might surprise you to learn that mathematicians did not complete a formal system for defining probability until Andrey Kolmogorov’s work in the 1930s. Many important insights and results had been noticed by earlier mathematicians, but our “classical” understanding of probability is still less than 100 years old. More recently, mathematicians have explored other systems of probability by relaxing or modifying Kolmogorov’s axioms. The most famous alternative system of probability is the “Bayesian” school, which I will not discuss here.\nKolmogorov’s definition of probability relies on the idea of an experiment. The “experiment” can be very broad or abstract, including actual experiments performed by scientists in laboratories but also natural phenomenon such as tomorrow’s weather and human activities such as a hedge fund’s annual performance.\nImagine an experiment made up of many different trials of the same experimental process. Each trial ends in a single outcome, and there are multiple possible outcomes (possibly an infinite number of outcomes). For example, let us consider an experiment where each trial involves flipping two coins, each marked H for heads and T for tails. Then the four ordered outcomes would be:\nEach trial ends in one outcome, but we will want to consider combinations of outcomes, which will be called events. For example, the event {HH, HT, TH} includes three outcomes, and we could think of this event as “a trial resulting in at least one head”. One special event is the empty set (seen earlier in Chapter 2), sometimes written \\(\\emptyset\\), which is an event containing no outcomes. This event never happens(!) but we still find it mathematically useful, just like we find zero helpful even if we don’t “see” zeroes around us. Set theory teaches us that for \\(n\\) different elements, there are \\(2^n\\) ways to choose combinations of those elements, which means that with four outcomes there are sixteen events:\nNotice that these combinations are unordered subsets of the outcomes. For example, I did not separately list both {HT, TT} and {TT, HT} as two different events, since they both contain the same two outcomes. On the other hand, the nature of our experiment requires that the order of the flips does matter: the event {HT, TT} is meaningfully different from the event {TH, TT}.\nLet’s review:",

    "section": "3.2 The axioms of probability",
    "text": "3.2 The axioms of probability\nHaving set up this idea of an experiment, we now define probability as a way of assigning a numeric score to each event in an experiment.\nThere are of course many ways we could make numeric scores for each event, and most of them are unhelpful. So we will need rules to help separate “probability” from all the other, unhelpful ways we could assign scores to events. Andrey Kolmogorov proposed the following three rules, often called the axioms of probability. If we assume these rules, all of probability and (classical) parametric statistics will follow:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nLet the triplet \\(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},P\\) define an experiment, where:\n\n\\(\\Omega\\) is the set of outcomes of the experiment (possible results of a single trial)\n\\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is the set of events of the experiment (combinations of outcomes)\n\\(P(E)\\) is a function which assigns a real number to each event \\(E\\) in \\(\\mathcal{F}\\)\n\nIf we choose \\(P\\) using the following three conditions,\n\n\\(P(E) \\geq 0 \\quad \\forall E \\in F\\) (All events have non-negative probability)\n\\(P(\\Omega)=1\\) (The probability of observing any of the outcomes is 1)\nIf a group of events \\(E_1,E_1,\\ldots,E_n\\) are disjoint then \\(P(\\bigcup_{i=1}^n E_i)=\\sum_{i=1}^n P(E_i)\\) (The combined probability of a union of mutually exclusive events is equal to the sum of the probabilities of each individual event)\n\nThen we say that \\(P\\) measures probability.\n\n\nNow that we have defined probability, let’s review some basic properties of how probability works. You have probably seen these before, or at least they should make a certain amount of sense. I will not prove them here, but they can all be proven from the axioms and other simple mathematical theorems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nLet the triplet \\(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},P\\) define an experiment, and let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be events within \\(\\mathcal{F}\\):\n\n\\(P(A^c ) = 1 - P(A)\\)\n\\(P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - (A \\cap B)\\)\nIf A and B are disjoint (mutually exclusive), then \\(P(A \\cap B) = P(A) + P(B)\\)\n\n\n\nThe first result above simply confirms that the probability of an event happening is equivalent to one minus the probability of the event not happening. The second result helps us to find the probability that \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) will happen (you can think of union as ‘or’ operator and intersection as ‘and’). If we simply add all the probability of \\(A\\) to all the probability of \\(B\\), we will double-count their intersection, which is in both sets. So we must subtract one intersection… unless the two sets are disjoint, in which case there is no problem!\n\n3.2.1 Joint, marginal, and conditional probability\nOften we wish to study the relationships between two or more experiments. For example, consider someone who takes a diagnostic test for a particular disease:\n\nOne experiment is whether the person actually has the disease\nA different experiment is whether the person tests positive for the disease, regardless of whether they actually have it\n\nMost people who test for a disease have some valid concern, and so among the test-takers let us assume that \\(P(\\mathrm{Disease})=0.60\\). Let us further assume that the test is imperfect, with few fase positives but lots of false negatives, and so \\(P(\\mathrm{Positive})=0.45\\).\nThese two pieces of information are not enough for us to understand the full implications of a positive test. A clearer sense of how these two experiments relate to each other could be expressed in a table as follows:\n\n\n\n\\[ \\begin{array}{rrccc} & & & \\textbf{Test Result} & \\\\ & & \\mathrm{Positive} & \\mathrm{Negative} & \\textit{Total} \\\\ & \\mathrm{Has\\ Disease} & 0.44 & 0.16 & \\textit{0.60} \\\\ \\textbf{Health} & \\mathrm{Does\\ Not} & 0.01 & 0.39 & \\textit{0.40} \\\\ & \\textit{Total} & \\textit{0.45} & \\textit{0.55} & \\end{array}\\]\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Contingency table of joint and marginal probabilities\n\n\n\nThe four cells at the top right are joint probabilities, which tell you the chance of simultaneously observing two pieces of information. For example, among people who test for this disease, 39% do not have the disease and yet test negative.\nThe four italicized cells along the bottom and right sides are marginal probabilities, which tell you the overall chance of one experiment’s outcome averaged over all possible results from the second experiment. Notice that we can compute these marginal probabilities by totaling the rows and columns of the joint probabilities in the literal margins of the table.\nFrom the combination of the joint and marginal probabilities, we can compute the conditional probabilities, which show us how the outcomes of one experiment become more or less likely once we know the result of the other. When we learn about the other experiment, we change the event space of the first experiment, since some joint outcomes are no longer possible. Events containing those outcomes are removed from \\(\\mathcal{F}\\). Probabilities shift such that the total of all remaining events sum to 1.\nIf we test positive, what is the probability we have the disease? We can disregard the second column above: we now “live” in the first column, totaling 45% (those who test positive). For every 45 people who test positive, 44 test positive and have the disease, while 1 tests positive and does not have the disease. Therefore, the probability of having the disease given a positive test is \\(0.44/0.45 \\approx 0.978.\\) We can formalize this result:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nLet the triplet \\(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},P\\) define an experiment, and let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be events within \\(\\mathcal{F}\\). The conditional probability of \\(A\\) given \\(B\\) is written \\(P(A|B)\\) and defined, \\[P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\\]\n\n\nWe can derive three useful rules from this definition of conditional probability. The first flows simply from the above formula if we multiply both sides by \\(P(B)\\):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nLet the triplet \\(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},P\\) define an experiment, and let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be events within \\(\\mathcal{F}\\). Then, \\[P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B) \\cdot P(B)\\]\n\n\nThis result allows us to compute the probability of a series of events by multiplying the branching probabilities of each conditional link. Consider an unfair coin which lands heads (“H”) 40% of the time and tails (“T”) 60% of the time. What is the probability of the sequence THH?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nconfig:\n  look: handDrawn\n  theme: neutral\n---\nflowchart LR\n  A((Begin)) -- 0.4 --&gt; B[H _ _]\n  A -- 0.6 --&gt; C[T _ _]\n  C -- 0.4 --&gt; D[T H _]\n  C -- 0.6 --&gt; E[T T _]\n  D -- 0.4 --&gt; F[T H H]\n  D -- 0.6 --&gt; G[T H T]\n  classDef stop stroke:red,color:red\n  class B,E,G stop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Chain of coin flip probabilities\n\n\n\nUsing the rule above, we can see that the probability of the full sequence could be expressed as P(THH)=P(T)∙P(TH|T)∙P(THT|TH)=0.6∙0.4∙0.6=0.144. The second useful result is known as The Law of Complete Probability, and allows us to compute the probability of an event by aggregating its conditional probability among a group of exhaustive and mutually exclusive conditions, meaning that exactly one of the conditions is always true. Let the triplet Ω,F,P define an experiment, and let A be an event within F. Let B_1,B_2,…,B_n also be events within F such that all events B_i are mutually exclusive and ∑_i▒P(B_i ) =1 Then, P(A)=∑_i▒〖P(A|B_i )∙P(B_i ) 〗 As an example, consider the proportion of time that my heart rate is elevated above 80 beats per minute. Elevated heart rates are rare in my sleep, perhaps occurring only during stressful dreams (perhaps 2% of my sleep?). When I’m awake, 80bpm is near my resting heart rate, and so I might spend 25% of my waking hours at rates above that. If I sleep on average 7 hours a day, then we can calculate P(elevated)=P(elevated|asleep)∙P(asleep)+P(elevated|awake)∙P(awake) =0.02∙(7/24)+0.25∙(17/24) ≈18.3% The last useful result I will mention here is a way to calculate P(B|A) from P(A|B). This formula is known as Bayes Theorem, after the English clergyman Reverend Thomas Bayes. Bayes was not a trained mathematician, but his natural curiosity and diligent amateur study led him to this significant result, published posthumously: Let the triplet Ω,F,P define an experiment, and let A and B be events within F. Then, P(B|A)=(P(A|B)∙P(B))/P(A) If we further assume that instead of one event B we have many events B_1,B_2,…,B_n such that all events B_i are mutually exclusive and ∑_i▒P(B_i ) =1, then further, P(B_j |A)=(P(A|B_j )∙P(B_j ))/(∑_i▒〖P(A|B_i )∙P(B_i ) 〗) The second equation above flows from the first equation when we apply our prior result of the Law of Complete Probability. For an example of the first equation at work, consider the heart rate hypothetical above: P(awake|elevated)=(P(elevated|awake)∙P(awake))/P(elevated) =(0.25∙(17/24))/(0.1829…)≈0.968 Notice the distinction: The probability that my heart rate is elevated given that I’m awake is pretty low: only 25% (I don’t exercise as often as I should). But the probability that I’m awake given that my heart rate is elevated is very high: almost 97%. This is both because my heart rarely races in my sleep, and because I’m more often awake than asleep. Bayes Theorem has lent its name to an alternative system of probability known as Bayesian probability, because they both allow the user to update their prior beliefs as more and more data are observed. This broader Bayesian system relaxes some of Kolmogorov’s axioms and creates entirely new models and computations which some “classical” or “frequentist” statisticians find controversial. However, using Bayes Theorem itself is uncontroversial and perfectly valid under Kolmogorov’s axioms.",

    "text": "Purpose and scope\nEleventy years ago, I studied probability and statistics “for statisticians”. Probability theory is elegant and contemplative. Graduate-level work can be completed with just pencil and paper, through proofs and symbolic notation.\nThe tools and methods discussed in these notes were built from such theoretical work. However, the students I teach are headed (generally) to industry, not to research positions or Ph.D programs. They may never need to author a proof, but they will need to draw conclusions about the world from noisy, biased, incomplete, or insufficient data, to perform their analyses within a modern day tech stack, and to communciate their findings to decisionmakers.\nSo I want to teach probability and statistics “for data scientists”. Data science is a tradecraft, not a body of theory, and it allows people and organizations to answer questions, solve problems, and achieve goals. Data science which does not help us to confront real problems or understand real datasets is not truly data science after all.\nI will try to stay focused on that mission in these notes, which should not be confused for a true textbook: they more closely resemble a detailed set of lecture slides, paired with ready-to-use code and interactive workshops. The layout of these notes echoes the syllabus for my class: a fast-paced survey of inferential statistics and parametric modeling methods, using likelihood estimation theory as a throughline for three main sections:\n\nFirst, we’ll review some topics in univariate analysis which may already be familiar to many readers.\nSecond, we’ll examine ordinary least squares (OLS) regression in more detail than readers may have seen at the college level.\nThird, we’ll abstract from OLS regression to the family of models called generalized linear models, which describe non-linear trends among non-normally distributed datasets.",

    "text": "1.1 Inferential statistics\nAll of the methods and theory presented in these notes are examples of parametric inference. If you aren’t already familiar with that term, it’s worth exploring now.\nWhen I was young, I first heard the term “statistics” used to summarize or highlight the values of a dataset:\nThese figures are correctly called statistics, but statisticians label them as descriptive statistics. They are incontrovertible facts. They are properties of a fixed sample which we can all agree upon. They do not require theory, just a calculation. Once I explain to you how to compute a median, you know that the median of the numbers {1,1,2,3,5,8,13} is 3, without having to argue over assumptions.\nBy contrast, the field of inferential statistics concerns itself with a shadowy world we cannot see and which might not exist. Inferential statistics starts from the assumption that the numbers in our world come to us from unknown, but systematic and guessable generating processes. The data we observe are realizations of random variables, and the random variables are defined by formulae, and the formulae are controlled by parameters. If we can correctly guess the general form of the random variables which created a given dataset, then the same dataset can help us to guess the specific parameters for each random variable. Once we know those parameters, we can usually answer more detailed questions about the generating process, even questions for which we have no direct observational evidence.\nFor example, our study of the Earth and the broader solar system suggests that meteors with a diameter of more than 1 km strike the Earth roughly every 500,000 years. We believe that such meteor strikes are closely approximated by a Poisson process, and that therefore the time between large meteor strikes could be represented by an exponential distribution with the parameter \\(\\lambda=0.000002\\) (here \\(\\lambda\\), or lambda, represents the long-term rate of meteor strikes per year).\nIf all this is true, then I can use the exponential distribution to calculate that the probability of a large meteor strike in my lifetime (or equivalently, in the next 50 years) is only about 0.01%:1\n\\[P(X \\le 50) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 50} = 1 - e^{-0.0001} \\approx 0.00009995\\]\nOf course, I cannot prove my calculation is right or wrong. If the next large meteor struck tomorrow, or just as I died, or two thousand years from now, none of these would validate or invalidate my estimate. But the estimate might still be flawed for several reasons. Further research might change our estimate of how often such meteors strike the Earth — perhaps it’s roughly once every 400,000 years, or every 600,000 years. We may even be wrong about meteor strikes being Poisson processes, and if they are not, then I would need a completely new set of assumptions.\nYet consider my approach:\nThese are the central concepts of inferential statistics. We make assumptions about how the world works, and then use data to estimate various unknown parameters. We are always wrong in our guesses –– and we don’t even know how wrong we are. We are sometimes even wrong about our distributional assumptions. I wouldn’t say we are taking guesses in the dark, but the room can be very dim indeed. However, our reward is to be able to describe things we have not seen, to predict the future, and to better understand the past.",

    "text": "1.2 How all parametric estimation is performed\nI described the steps above in generalities. We have not yet discussed how to make a guess about the parameters of a distribution. Nor have we discussed what makes one guessing method better or worse than other guessing methods. Before I can talk about these subjects, we need to introduce a few definitions.\nWe will start with some data. Perhaps we have a univariate vector of \\(n\\) observations: \\(\\boldsymbol{x} = \\{x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n\\}\\).2 I will frequently describe \\(\\boldsymbol{x}\\) as our sample, even if it was collected by non-sampling methods.\nNext, let’s introduce a distributional assumption. The data \\(x\\) are realizations of a random variable \\(X\\) with a cumulative distribution function \\(F_X\\) controlled by one or more parameters \\(\\theta\\) (theta). The probability or density of each observation \\(x_i\\) depends not only on its value but also on the parameters \\(\\theta\\). We could write,\n\\[P(X \\le x_i) = F_X(x_i;\\theta) \\qquad \\forall i \\in \\mathbb{N}:\\ 1 \\le i \\le n\\]\nStatistics textbooks sometimes refer to \\(\\theta\\) as the estimand. In my experience, very few real-world professionals use this term. From now on, we will simply refer to \\(\\theta\\) as the parameters or often the unknown parameters, which emphasizes the fact that we rarely know their true value.\nNow, let’s make a guess as the value(s) of \\(\\theta\\). There are several methods we could use to make this guess, general systems for guessing that work well for many distributions and many datasets. Right now, the specific method we use is unimportant. What is important is that our guess should be some function of the data in front of us. That is, our data \\(\\boldsymbol{x}\\) should inform our guess for the parameters \\(\\theta\\). The calculation which transforms our data into a guess of the parameter is called the estimator and written \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) (theta-hat):\n\\[\\hat{\\theta} = g(\\boldsymbol{x})\\]\nWritten this way, \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is a calculation, a function \\(g\\) that we apply to each new sample \\(\\boldsymbol{x}\\), producing a different result for different samples. Anytime we use our estimator \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) on a specific sample, the result of this calculation is called the estimate of \\(\\theta\\). The estimator is the function, and the estimate is its value for a specific sample.\nAllow me a metaphor to sum this all up. Inferential statistics is like baking chocolate chip cookies. We each have an idea of what chocolate chip cookies should taste like (please take a moment to imagine your own perfect cookie). This theoretical goal is the unknown parameter. We want to make the best real-world version of this unattainable perfection. We can choose from many recipes, or even make a new recipe of our own. Some recipes lean toward one texture or another, or accentuate some flavors more than others. Each different recipe is a different estimator. We may think one recipe is better than another, but that doesn’t mean that it always produces a perfect batch of cookies. Depending on the materials at hand — the freshness of the ingredients, the specific brand of chocolate, the shape and reliability of the oven, our altitude — even our favorite recipe might produce a bad batch of cookies, or an unloved recipe might produce a surprisingly good batch of cookies. Each individual batch is a different estimate, and those conditions which vary batch-to-batch are the data.",

    "text": "1.3 Statistical models and machine learning models\nNow that we’ve reviewed the aims of parametric inference, you might wonder how it differs from any other type of data analysis. After all, don’t all quantitative methods use the information in a dataset to answer questions about the world around us?\nA statistical model makes a strong assumption that the data has a functional form, i.e. that the data are realizations of a random variable with a known distribution type. The only unknowns are the specific values of the parameters which created the data. Finding estimates for these parameters is typically the “finish line” for the analysis: most of the useful findings flow directly from the estimated theoretical distribution.\nStatistical models are high-risk and high-reward. Very few datasets are perfectly distributed according to known probability distributions. Even if the generating process is well understood, the parameters which govern the data might change over time, and the dataset we use may give us outdated information. The extremes of the distribution will typically be the least observed, and we may produce catastrophically bad predictions when we naively fit the wrong distributions to these unobserved regions.3\nAt first, we accepted these risks because we had no other choice. There were few alternative methods, and practitioners were limited by the data and technology of their day: dozens or hundreds of observations, studied without electronic help or with relatively primitive computing resources.\nAll these drawbacks are also the strengths of statistical modeling. Statistical models can give a wide range of answers about how a generating process will behave in conditions never seen in the data. Statistical models are often very resource-light, and some can even be computed by hand. Statistical models will work with almost any amount of data and can give useful results with very small sample sizes. The parameters that we estimate from statistical models often give us powerful insight into how and why the world works.\nA machine learning (ML) model, by contrast, does not believe or require that the data were generated by a probability distribution. ML models are generally uninterested in the idea of a single generating process which created all the data. They explore clusters and breakpoints within the data, seeking to find useful rulesets or “views” of the data which preserve as much of the original information as possible.\nAn ML model might use parametric components which are iteratively tuned in order to minimize an error function. For example, the bins created by a decision tree or the hyperplane classifiers of support vector machines are both defined by parameters. But these parameters are generally not associated with probability distributions.\nML models typically offer less interpretability than statistical models. They are less eager to find hidden “truths” in the world around us, less able to explain how changes in the inputs result in changes to the outputs. They can also be very resource-intensive, requiring both large amounts of data as well as large amounts of computing power.\nIn return, ML models offer flexibility and robustness in situations which would defy statistical modeling. ML models usually perform better than statistical models on very large datasets, which are more likely the result of many different generating processes rather than a single generating process. ML models thrive on heterogeneity and local differences in behavior, which often confound or mislead statistical models. You will learn about them in other courses. For now, we will focus on statistical models.",

    "section": "1.4 Maximum likelihood estimation",
    "text": "1.4 Maximum likelihood estimation\nLet’s begin studying statistical inference with the simplest of cases: trying to determine the distribution which generated a single column of numbers. I assume your familiarity with some of the most common probability distributions: the discrete Bernoulli, binomial, geometric, and Poisson distributions, along with the continuous uniform, exponential, and normal distributions. If you need a refresher, the appendices contain more detail about each of these distributions and others we will study in later sections.\nWhen we ask our computers today to model our data with set of parameters (such as the slope and intercept of a simple regression), the computer usually solves for the unknown parameters using maximum likelihood estimation, a method which was originally developed by Ronald Fisher over 100 years ago. The basic premise of maximum likelihood is to assume that the data aren’t… weird. Of course, the data could be weird: they could be unrepresentative or contain wild outliers. But usually, and by definition, our data aren’t unusual. So we will suppose that the best guess for the unknown parameters will be the values which make the data seem the most ordinary. There are other estimation methods worth learning, but in this course we will focus heavily on maximum likelihood estimation.\n\n1.4.1 Motivation and definition\nWhen we conduct statistical inference, we begin with data, and then we proceed to ask what distribution (and which parameters) could have created the data. Notice that this situation reverses the problems you might find in a high school or college class on probability. In those earlier classes, you would often be asked “if the parameters for this distribution are \\(\\theta\\), then what is the probability of observing \\(\\boldsymbol{x}\\)?” For example:\n\nIf a fair coin is flipped 50 times, what is the probability of observing exactly 27 heads and 23 tails?\nIf the heights of adult women in the United States are normally distributed with a mean of 162 cm and a standard deviation of 7 cm, what is the probability of drawing a sample of ten women who are all shorter than 152 cm?\n\nInstead, the shoe is now on the other foot:\n\nWe flip a coin 50 times and observe 27 heads and 23 tails. Is it reasonable to believe that the coin is fair, despite these lopsided results?\nWe observe the heights of ten women, and we assume they represent a sample from a population which is normally distributed. Based on our sample, what are realistic ranges for the unknown mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\)?\n\nTo answer these questions, we will invent a way to “score” each set of possible parameters for a specific dataset. The parameters which seem well fit to the data will receive a higher score. We will consider all parameter choices which score highly as reasonable guesses for the unknown truth, but if we need to make just one guess, then we will choose the parameter or set of parameters with the highest score. We will call this scoring function likelihood.\nImagine a univariate sample \\(\\boldsymbol{x} = x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n\\) which we believe came from a discrete probability distribution \\(X\\) with parameters \\(\\theta\\), and assume for the moment that the observations are independent of each other. Then we could compute the probability of observing the entire sample simply by multiplying together the probabilities of each individual observation:\n\\[P(\\boldsymbol{x}|\\theta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n P(X=x_i|\\theta)\\]\nThe equation above treats \\(\\theta\\) as a fixed assumption and \\(\\boldsymbol{x}\\) as the input variable. Now we will repurpose this same function but treat \\(\\boldsymbol{x}\\) as the assumption and \\(\\theta\\) as the variable. We will also take the opportunity to extend this idea to a continuous case, using densities rather than probability mass functions:\n\nLet \\(X\\) be a random variable dependent on one or more parameters \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{x} = x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n\\) be independent sample observations where \\(x_i \\sim X \\quad \\forall i \\in \\mathbb{N}: \\ 1 \\le i \\le n.\\) Then we write the likelihood of \\(\\theta\\) given \\(\\boldsymbol{x}\\) as \\(\\mathcal{L}(\\theta|\\boldsymbol{x})\\). If \\(X\\) is discrete, we define:\n\\[\\mathcal{L}(\\theta|\\boldsymbol{x})=\\prod_{i=1}^n P(X=x_i|\\theta)\\]\nAnd if \\(X\\) is continuous with probability distribution function (PDF) \\(f_X\\), we define:\n\\[\\mathcal{L}(\\theta|\\boldsymbol{x})=\\prod_{i=1}^n f_X(x_i|\\theta)\\]\nIf \\(\\theta\\) has \\(k\\) parameters, let \\(\\mathcal{S} \\in \\mathbb{R}^k\\) be the set of values \\(\\theta\\) can take which are permitted by the distribution of \\(X\\) and the observed values of \\(\\boldsymbol{x}\\). Then the choice for \\(\\theta\\) which maximizes \\(\\mathcal{L}(\\theta|\\boldsymbol{x})\\) is referred to as the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for \\(\\theta\\):\n\\[\\hat{\\theta}_\\textit{MLE} = \\mathop{\\mathrm{argmax}}_{\\theta \\in \\mathcal{S}} \\,\\mathcal{L}(\\theta|\\boldsymbol{x})\\]\n\nNotice that likelihood functions are usually products of the individual probabilities/densities of each observation in the sample. It can be difficult to directly maximize a complicated product of many terms. Happily, we can use one or two tricks which greatly simplify maximum likelihood estimation. The first trick is to notice that the log of a function reaches its maximum or minimum at the same input values as the original function (that is, logarithms are a monotonic transformation). Below I plot the likelihood function for the coin data mentioned above: 27 heads and 23 tails. I also will plot the log of the likelihood function:\n\n\nCode\n#generate coin data\ncoins &lt;- c(rep(1,27),rep(0,23))\n\n#compute likelihood and log-likelihood functions\ncoin.lik &lt;- function(p) p^sum(coins)*(1-p)^sum(1-coins)\ncoin.ll &lt;- function(p) sum(coins)*log(p)+sum(1-coins)*log(1-p)\n\n#plot coin likelihood and log-likelihood\npar(mfrow=c(1,2),bty='n',cex=0.8)\nplot((1:99)/100, coin.lik((1:99)/100),type='l',lwd=2,\n     main=\"Likelihood of Coin Parameter 'p'\",\n     xlab='p (Prob. of Heads)',ylab='Likelihood')\nabline(v=mean(coins),lwd=2,lty=2,col='grey50')\ntext(x=mean(coins),y=0,pos=4,col='grey50',\n     labels=paste0('x=',round(mean(coins),2)))\n\nplot((1:99)/100, coin.ll((1:99)/100),type='l',lwd=2,\n     main=\"Log-likelihood of Coin Parameter 'p'\",\n     xlab='p (Prob. of Heads)',ylab='Log-likelihood')\nabline(v=mean(coins),lwd=2,lty=2,col='grey50')\ntext(x=mean(coins),y=-120,pos=4,col='grey50',\n     labels=paste0('x=',round(mean(coins),2)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Likelihood and log-likelihood of coin flip data\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the log of a product is simply the sum of logs of each term in the product, we often find log-likelihood proves easier to maximize than the original likelihood function.\n\nLet \\(\\mathcal{L}(\\theta|\\boldsymbol{x})\\) be the likelihood of a parameter \\(\\theta\\) given a sample \\(\\boldsymbol{x}\\) and a distributional assumption about the random variable \\(X\\) from which the sample was drawn. Then we denote the log-likelihood of \\(\\theta\\) given \\(\\boldsymbol{x}\\) as \\(\\ell(\\theta|\\boldsymbol{x})\\) and define it as\n\\[\\ell(\\theta│\\boldsymbol{x})=\\log{\\mathcal{L}(\\theta│\\boldsymbol{x})}\\]\n\nThe second trick which we use to more easily maximize likelihood is calculus. When a likelihood function is continuously differentiable and has a local maximum (as the two graphs do above), then the same parameter value which maximizes the likelihood and log-likelihood will be a root of the first derivative of the log-likelihood:\n\n\nCode\n# create first derivative of coin log-likelihood function\ncoin.dll &lt;- function(p) sum(coins)/p-sum(1-coins)/(1-p)\n\n# graph first derivative of coin log-likelihood function\npar(mfrow=c(1,1),bty='n',cex=0.8)\nplot((1:99)/100, coin.dll((1:99)/100),type='l',lwd=2,\n     main=\"Derivative of LL of Coin Parameter 'p'\",\n     xlab='p (Prob. of Heads)',ylab='dLL/dp')\nabline(h=0)\nabline(v=sum(coins)/length(coins),lwd=2,lty=2,col='grey50')\ntext(x=sum(coins)/length(coins),y=-2000,pos=4,col='grey50',\n     labels=paste0('x=',round(sum(coins)/length(coins),2)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: First derivative of the log-likelihood of coin flip data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Example 1: Coin flips\nSuppose that we were given a coin and told it was fixed to land on one side more than the other. We flip the coin 50 times and record each ‘heads’ as 1 and each ‘tails’ as 0. The results below show that the coin landed ‘heads’ 27 times and ‘tails’ 23 times.\n\\[\\boldsymbol{x}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}{0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,\\\\ 0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0}\\end{array}\\right\\}\\] Let us make a distributional assumption: the coin data can be modeled by a Bernoulli distribution. We cannot know whether this is correct or not, but it seems reasonable: Bernoulli trials require exactly two outcomes, a fixed probability of success, and independence between trials. While it’s possible that the coin could land on its edge, or that it deforms over time, or that it shows serial correlation, modeling the coin flips as Bernoulli trials seems true enough to be useful.4\nWhat is the probability of observing the data if the coin truly lands heads 60% of the time? You should be able to answer this from your past lessons in probability and statistics. Since we assume trials to be independent, we can write:\n\\[P(\\boldsymbol{x} | p = 0.6) = \\prod_{i = 1}^{50} P(x_i | p = 0.6) = 0.4 \\cdot 0.4 \\cdot 0.6 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot 0.4 = 0.6^{27} \\cdot 0.4^{23} \\approx 7.2×10^{-16}\\] A very small number… although these results are actually quite unextraordinary, there are simply so many ways that 50 coin flips can occur (1.13 quadrillion ways) that even the most common sequences each have a very, very low probability.\nWhat is the likelihood for any given parameter \\(p\\), given our dataset of 27 heads in 50 flips?\n\\[\\mathcal{L}(p|\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{50} P(x_i|p) = p^{27} (1-p)^{23}\\]\nWhat is the value of \\(p\\) which maximizes this likelihood? It’s not immediately evident from the equation above, but perhaps the log-likelihood will help us to solve for \\(p\\):\n\\[\\ell(p|\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\log{\\mathcal{L}(p|\\boldsymbol{x})} = 27\\log{⁡p}+23\\log⁡(1-p)\\]\nThis is still difficult to solve by hand, so let’s bring in the final trick, and instead try to find the root of the first derivative of the log-likelihood:\n\\[\\frac{d}{dp} \\ell(p│\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\frac{27}{p}-\\frac{23}{1-p}\\]\nSetting the above equal to zero and solving for p,\n\\[\\frac{27}{p}-\\frac{23}{1-p} = 0 \\Longrightarrow \\frac{27}{p} = \\frac{23}{1-p} \\Longrightarrow 27-27p = 23p \\Longrightarrow 50p=27 \\Longrightarrow \\hat{p}_\\textit{MLE} = \\frac{27}{50}=0.54\\]\nIn fact, we could abstract a little further here to find the MLE for any Bernoulli-distributed sample. Let \\(k\\) be the number of successes and \\(n\\) be the total number of trials. Using the same math as above, you will find that:\n\\[\\hat{p}_\\mathit{MLE} = k/n = \\frac{\\sum_i x_i}{n} = \\bar{x}\\] This is a tidy little result. When our data are Bernoulli distributed, then the maximum likelihood estimator for the parameter \\(p\\) is simply the sample average, i.e. the proportion of observations that were successes. I like findings such as these which conform with our intuition: when we have data on a Bernoulli process, our best guess as to how often successes truly happen will simply be how often successes occurred in our data.\n\n\n1.4.3 Example 2: Heights\nThe above example used a very simple discrete distribution with a single parameter. Let’s try again with a more complicated continuous distribution, which uses two parameters. Across the entire world population, heights are not exactly distributed according to any known distribution. However, among otherwise homogeneous populations, we do observe that heights are roughly normally distributed. Let’s pretend that we sampled 10 adult women in the United States and measured their heights. Rounded to the nearest tenth of a centimeter, their heights are listed below:5\n\\[\\boldsymbol{x}=\\{170.1,161.6,175.2,166.3,165.6,165.8,152.0,155.8,168.6,154.3\\}\\] Let us assume that these heights are drawn from a normal distribution. What then would be the best guess for the parameters \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\), which are the mean and variance of the distribution? We will start by finding the likelihood function. Recall that if \\(X\\) is normal,\n\\[f_X(x|\\mu,\\sigma^2)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}(x-\\mu)^2}\\] From this, we can compute the likelihood of any pair of normal parameters for any dataset:\n\\[\\mathcal{L}(\\mu,\\sigma^2|\\boldsymbol{x}) = (2\\pi\\sigma^2)^{-n/2}\\cdot e^{-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\sum_{i}(x_i-\\mu)^2}\\] Then, we can find the log-likelihood:\n\\[\\ell(\\mu,\\sigma^2|\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\log{\\mathcal{L}(\\mu,\\sigma^2|\\boldsymbol{x})} = -\\frac{n}{2}\\log{2\\pi\\sigma^2} - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i}(x_i-\\mu)^2\\]\nNext, we will take the derivative with respect to \\(\\mu\\):\n\\[\\frac{\\partial\\ell}{\\partial\\mu} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i}(x_i-μ) \\] From here we will solve for the root of the derivative, which will be the value of \\(\\mu\\) that maximizes the original likelihood function:\n\\[\\frac{\\partial\\ell}{\\partial\\mu} = 0 \\Longrightarrow \\sum_i (x_i-\\mu) = 0 \\Longrightarrow \\sum_i x_i - n\\mu = 0 \\Longrightarrow n\\mu=\\sum_i x_i \\Longrightarrow \\hat{\\mu}_\\textit{MLE} = \\bar{x}\\]\nWhat a fantastic bit of luck. The best guess for the true mean of a normal distribution is the sample mean of our data! Let’s finish up by repeating for variance: first we take the partial derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to \\(\\sigma^2\\):\n\\[\\frac{\\partial\\ell}{\\partial\\sigma^2} = -\\frac{n}{2\\sigma^2} + \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^4}\\sum_i (x_i-\\mu)^2\\] Then we will solve for the root of the derivative, which will be the value of \\(\\sigma^2\\) which maximizes the original likelihood function:\n\\[\\frac{\\partial\\ell}{\\partial\\sigma^2} =0 \\Longrightarrow \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^4} \\sum_i (x_i-\\mu)^2 = \\frac{n}{2\\sigma^2} \\Longrightarrow \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\sum_i (x_i-\\mu)^2 = n \\Longrightarrow \\hat{\\sigma}^2_\\textit{MLE} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_i (x_i-\\mu)^2\\]\nYou may recognize this quantity as the biased (uncorrected) sample variance. Although this calculation seems very sensible, we will later show that it systematically underestimates the true variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), which provides our first hint that maximum likelihood estimation is not the final answer for every problem we will encounter.\nWith these results in hand, we can produce the MLEs for our normal parameters given our height data. We would say that the best guess for the true mean height of adult women in the United States is 163.5 cm and the best guess for their variance would be 50.4 cm\\({}^2\\) (implying a standard deviation of 7.1 cm).6\n\n\nCode\n#generate height data\nheights &lt;- c(170.1,161.6,175.2,166.3,165.6,165.8,152.0,155.8,168.6,154.3)\n\n#generate height parameter ll contour plot\nheight.ll &lt;- function(parms) {-1*length(heights)*log(2*pi*parms[2])/2-sum((heights-parms[1])^2)/(2*parms[2])}\nxgrid &lt;- seq(140,180,0.1)\nygrid &lt;- seq(25,80,0.1)\nzgrid &lt;- matrix(apply(cbind(rep(xgrid,times=length(ygrid)),rep(ygrid,each=length(xgrid))),\n                      1,height.ll),ncol=length(ygrid))\nfilled.contour(xgrid,ygrid,zgrid,levels=c(-120,-100,-80,-70,-60,-50,-40,-35,-34,-33.8,-33.7),\n               col=paste0('#000000',c('00','20','40','60','80','9f','af','cf','ef','ff')),\n               main='Log-Lik of Parameters for Height Data',\n               xlab='Mu (mean height, in cm)',ylab='Sigma^2 (variance)')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Contour plot of height data log-likelihoods\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can confirm that these solutions are reasonable by plotting the log-likelihood of various combinations of mean and variance, seen above. Notice that a broad range of possible means and variances have log-likelihoods close to the maximum value of -33.8. Any of these combinations could easily have generated our data. But if we have to make one guess, then the MLE values of (163.5, 50.4) would be our best choice.",
